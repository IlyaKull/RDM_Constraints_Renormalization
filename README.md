# RDM_Constraints_Renormalization
A demonstration of the constraints renormalization method described in https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03014

The main results in the paper (for 1D systems) were produced using the code in the folder spinChains_1D. 
The folder LTI_hierarchy_in_2D contains the code used for the 2D results in section VII of the paper.

Implemented in MATLAB. YALMIP is required https://yalmip.github.io/
